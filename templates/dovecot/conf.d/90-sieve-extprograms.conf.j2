# Sieve Extprograms plugin configuration

# Don't forget to add the sieve_extprograms plugin to the sieve_plugins setting.
# Also enable the extensions you need (one or more of vnd.dovecot.pipe,
# vnd.dovecot.filter and vnd.dovecot.execute) by adding these	to the
# sieve_extensions or sieve_global_extensions settings. Restricting these
# extensions to a global context using sieve_global_extensions is recommended.
